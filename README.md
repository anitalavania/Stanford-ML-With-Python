# Stanford-ML-With-Python

This is a re-coding of Andrew Ng's ML course exercises from scratch but in python.
I aim to git-push one exercise per week over the next 8 weeks.


Codes are tried and tested on python 3.9.7.

User is advised to double-check the input data file paths.

Libraries frequently used: Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot, scipy, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d

However, installation of the Anaconda distribution is strongly advised.
